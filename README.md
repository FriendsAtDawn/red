A couple of poems deploying throught cloudflare. Because code is poetry, and poetry is magic.

The site has no much, not a fan of poetry as a writer but a huge fan as a reder.

Theres a nonsensical lines about a name and a very decent translate of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 to Spanish, that, Â¡is a Sonnet!, rhymes.
